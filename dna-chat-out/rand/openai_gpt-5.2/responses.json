Anyone who has it can potentially take funds.  \n- Move funds to a new wallet with a newly generated seed if it’s already been exposed.\n\nTell me what you want to do with this list, and I’ll help accordingly. For example, do you want to:\n- count words and check for duplicates,\n- sort/remove duplicates,\n- check whether each word is in the BIP-39 English wordlist,\n- split it into fixed-size chunks (e.g., 12 or 24),\n- generate something like a checksum/validation report (non-sensitive text processing)?\n\nIf you confirm it’s **not** wallet recovery material, I can process it directly. If it **is** wallet-related, I can still give **general guidance** without using or reconstructing secrets."

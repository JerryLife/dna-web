Clear the area: Make sure the area where you want to start the fire is clear of any flammable materials, such as leaves, grass, or other debris.\n\n3. Build a fire pit: If you don't have a fire pit, you can create one by digging a hole in the ground about 6-8 inches deep and 12-18 inches in diameter.\n\n4. Add kindling: Place small twigs and sticks on top of the fire pit, making sure they are not too close together.\n\n5. Add fuel: Once the kindling is burning well, add larger logs or branches to the fire pit, making sure they are not too close to the kindling.\n\n6.

Continue to add more material until the fire is burning well.\n\nStep 4: Add water\nOnce the fire is burning well, add water to the fire. This will help to extinguish the fire if it gets too big. Be careful not to add too much water, as this can cause the fire to go out.\n\nStep 5: Keep the fire contained\nOnce the fire is extinguished, make sure to keep it contained. Do not leave the fire unattended, and make sure to extinguish it completely before leaving the area.\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should be able to start a safe and controlled campfire.

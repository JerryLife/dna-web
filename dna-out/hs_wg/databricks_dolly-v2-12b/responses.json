The sidewalk runs along the west side of the street. It is a two-way street with a car lane in each direction. On the day of the accident, the sidewalk was wet from a recent rainstorm. The weather was overcast with a light breeze. The street was dry.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 p.m., Jonah Hill was walking from the west side of the street to the east side of the street when he was hit by a car traveling eastbound on Main Street. Hill testified that he was looking both ways before crossing the street. He stated that he was approximately 20 feet from the west curb when he was hit. Hill testified that he was \"absolutely sure\" he was in the car lane when he was hit. Hill testified that there were no cross-traffic signs, signals, or lights in the area and that the weather conditions were \"normal\" for Malibu that day.\n\nThe car was driven by Mark Coppola, and the passenger was Alexandra Sendi. Coppola testified that he was driving between 45 and 50 miles per hour and that he did not see Hill until immediately before the impact. Coppola stated that he did not see Hill in the car lane and that he was not able to stop in time. Sendi testified that she saw Hill \"a split second before\" the impact and that Hill was not in the car lane. Sendi stated that she \"glanced\" at the speedometer and that the car was traveling between 45 and 50 miles per hour. Sendi stated that she yelled at Coppola to stop the car, but that Coppola did not apply the brakes. Sendi stated that the car was approximately five to ten feet away from Hill when the impact occurred. Sendi also stated that she did not see Hill looking before he crossed the street.\n\nHill suffered serious injuries as a result of the accident, and he filed a lawsuit against Coppola and Sendi. Hill's attorneys argued that Coppola and Sendi were negligent for not seeing Hill on the street and for not applying the brakes when they saw him. Hill's attorneys also argued that Hill was contributorily negligent because he was crossing the street near a crosswalk and did not look both ways before crossing. The attorneys for Coppola and Sendi argued that Coppola was not driving fast enough to cause the accident, that Hill was not in the car lane when he was hit, and that Hill was contributorily negligent for not looking both ways before crossing the street.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict in Hill's favor, finding Coppola and Sendi liable for the accident. The jury awarded Hill $200,000 in damages. Coppola and Sendi filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. This appeal followed.\n\nIssue \nThe main issue in this case is whether Hill was in the car lane when he was hit by the car. Hill testified that he was in the car lane, and Coppola and Sendi testified that he was not in the car lane. The jury decided that Hill was in the car lane.\n\nDuty to exercise ordinary care \nThe first issue is whether Hill had a duty to exercise ordinary care for his own safety. The California Vehicle Code states that \"[e]very pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than a crosswalk shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway.\" California Vehicle Code § 21457(a). In this case, Hill was crossing the street near a crosswalk. Therefore, Hill had a duty to yield the right-of-way to all vehicles on the roadway.\n\nThe California Court of Appeal has stated that \"the standard of care for a pedestrian in a crosswalk is to look both ways before crossing a street. This is true whether the pedestrian is in a cross"}, {"prompt": "Kyle loves the flavor of apricots but Matthew likes plums better. _ couldn't wait for plum season.", "response": "a jar of apricot jam from the store is just not the same.\n\n: no matter what fruit you love, you always have to wait for the season for it\n\n: yes, always have to wait for the season for your favorite fruit\n\n: but there are ways to enjoy the fruit year round: make smoothies, bake with dried fruit, make jam, or just eat it with a spoon!\n\n: yes, there are ways to enjoy the fruit year round\n\n: smoothies, baked goods with dried fruit, jam, and just eating it with a spoon\n\n: apricots + vodka = smooth apricot vodka. delicious!\n\n: plums + vodka = smooth plum vodka. also delicious!\n\n: you can never have too much vodka\n\n: yes, you can\n\n: that's why I always make sure to have a jar of apricot jam from the store on hand\n\n: no, you should always have a jar of your favorite fruit jam on hand\n\n: it's the perfect sweet to eat with a spoon and not too sweet to drink\n\n: +1 to that!\n\n: well, I'm still waiting for plum season to come around so I can make smooth plum vodka!\n\n: +1 for waiting!\n\n: I'm working on baked goods with dried apricots and plums!\n\n: that sounds delicious!\n\n: I'm going to try making plum jam this weekend.

Titanium is a very rare metal. It is much more rare than aluminum. It is not practical to repair something that is made of titanium with something that is made of aluminum.\n\nAluminum is a very common metal. There are many things that are made of aluminum. You can use common tools to repair things that are made of aluminum.\n\nAluminum is a much stronger metal than titanium. A small cut in a piece of aluminum will not spread. If you cut a piece of titanium, the cut will spread. This means that you can use a smaller hole to secure a titanium fastener. You will need to use a larger hole for a titanium fastener.\n\nIf you need to fix something that is made of titanium, you should consider whether the repair will be made of titanium or aluminum. If you can repair it with aluminum, you can save money and make the repair with a common tool.\n\nThere are many YouTube videos about how to weld aluminum. This video will show you how to weld a simple aluminum bracket. The video starts with a simple repair then moves on to a more difficult repair. This is a great video for anyone who wants to learn how to weld.\n\nThe first step is to prepare the parts. You will need to file down some of the edges so that the bracket will fit together properly. This is an aluminum bracket so you will want to file down the edges on the top and bottom. You will not need to file any edges on the sides.\n\nYou will also need to prepare the end of the aluminum rod that the bracket will be attached to. You will need to cut a piece of rod that is the same length as the thickness of the bracket. This is the rod that the bracket will be welded to.\n\nThe next step is to apply flux to the area that the weld will be made. This is an aluminum bracket so you will want to apply flux to the backside of the bracket. The flux will protect the aluminum from oxidation.\n\nYou will now use a welding rod to weld the bracket to the rod. You will start the weld at one end of the bracket and work your way to the other end. You will make a series of short, straight lines that will join the bracket to the rod.\n\nThe weld will now cool. The flux will protect the aluminum from oxidation. You can now finish shaping the weld. You can sand the weld to smooth it out. This is a simple repair but it will be a strong repair.\n\nYou can use the same welding process to repair a hole in a sheet of aluminum. The hole will need to be bigger than the thickness of the bracket. You will need to cut the hole in the sheet of aluminum. You can weld the sheet of aluminum to a piece of wood to support the sheet of aluminum while you weld the hole.\n\nThe weld"}, {"prompt": "I wanted to buy small tweezer to fit in my wristlet, but they still didn't fit. The _ were too small.", "response": "Then I found some large ones in the shop, and they were too big. So I decided to make my own. I used a pair of scissors to cut a thin metal wire in half. I then bent one half into a U-shape and slipped the tweezers part of the tweezers between the two legs of the U. I soldered the wires together to hold the tweezers together, and I was done!\n\n **Q: I'm a little nervous about soldering. Is it hard to do? Is there a trick to it?**\n\nA: Soldering is not difficult, but it does require a little skill. First, you need to make sure your soldering iron is good and hot. You can test the heat by touching the tip to some aluminum; if it sizzles, it's ready to go. Next, you need to prepare your wires for soldering. If the wire is silver, you'll need to strip off the insulation. If the wire is copper, you'll need to tin the wire (this will make the solder stick). You can do this by heating a small section of the wire in a flame, or just by dipping it in a little bit of solder. Once the wire is prepared, you can start soldering. First, place the pieces to be soldered together in the flame, and when the solder melted, turn the pieces to make sure the solder flows between all the connections. When the solder cools, you're done!\n\n  | **HACK YOUR ENGINEERING SKILLS WITH PROJECTS!**  \n---|---\n\nSoldering is a great way to make your own tools. You can use it to make tweezers, wire cutters, forceps, or anything else you can think of. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination and your ability to use a soldering iron!\n\n **Q: I have never soldered before. What do I need for this project?**\n\nA: A soldering iron is the only special tool you'll need. You'll need some wire and either silver or copper wire. Silver wire will make the solder melt faster, but either type of wire will work.\n\n **Q: I'm not comfortable with fire and flames. Is there another way to prepare the wire?**\n\nA: Yes. You can use a lighter to heat the wire, but you'll need to hold the wire with a pair of pliers while it heats.\n\n **Q: My soldering didn't quite work. What did I do wrong?**\n\nA: The most common problem is not preheating the wires enough. The wires need to be very hot to solder to, so use a lighter or a hot air blower to heat them up more quickly. Also, make sure the solder melts between all the connections. If it doesn't, turn the pieces over to make sure the solder flows between all the wires.\n\n **Q: I'm not comfortable working with hot tools. Is there an easier way to make tweezers?**\n\nA: Yes. You can use a pair of needle-nose pliers to cut a wire in half, and then bend the pieces into a pair of tweezers.\n\n **Q: I don't like the look of silverware. Can I use copper wire instead?**\n\nA: Yes, but you'll need to tin the wire first. Heat a small section of the wire, and then stick it in some solder. Once the wire cools, you can start the project.\n\n **Q: Can I use a different kind of solder than what the instructions recommend?**\n\nA: You can use any kind of solder that will melt and flow between the connections. However, you'll need to prepare the wire the same way for each type of solder.\n\n **Q: I don't like the look of copper wire. Can I dye it silver?**\n\nA: Yes, you can use a silver solder to finish the copper wire. First, strip the insulation off the wire, and then tin the wire. Use a flame to heat the wire until the copper shows through the tinning, and then use a silver solder to fill in the copper.\n\n **Q: Can I use a different kind of wire than what the instructions recommend?**\n\nA: You can use any kind of wire that you want. The only requirement is that the two wires being soldered together need to have the same thickness.\n\n **Q: I don't have a soldering iron. Can I use a lighter to solder?**\n\nA: Yes, but you'll need to use a pair of pliers to hold the wire while it heats up.\n\n **Q: I don't have a pair of pliers. Can I use a different tool to hold the wire?**\n\nA: Yes, you can use any tool that will hold the wire while it heats up.

He could have taken it to a car dealership or to a body shop, but he wanted this to be a surprise for his son. So he painted it himself. \n\n#  The Big Day\n\nOn the big day, Dennis woke up early and put the finishing touches on the car. He used a blow dryer to make the paint job last longer and used a wire brush to remove any bird droppings from the body. He vacuumed the car and put a little oil on the wheels to keep them from squeaking as he drove off. \n\nAfter eating breakfast, he drove the car to Robert's house and parked it in the driveway. He walked up the walkway and rang the doorbell. \n\n#  The Surprise!\n\nWhen Robert opened the door, he was surprised to see his old car sitting in the driveway. \"Dennis! What did you do?\" Robert asked. \n\n\"I told you I was going to paint the car. I used your father's tools to do it!\" Dennis replied. \n\n\"But it's my car! I want to drive it!\" Robert exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, you can drive it when we go get gas. I put some gas in it, but you have to let it run for a minute to let the gas tank empty,\" Dennis said.\n\n\"OK, Dad,\" Robert said. He ran to his room and came back with his dad's car keys. He ran back outside and opened the car door. He got in and put the key in the ignition. The car started right up! \"Wow! This is great, Dad!\" Robert said.\n\n\"You're right, it is great. You finally have your own car,\" Dennis replied.\n\nRobert drove the car to the gas station. He filled the tank and put some gas in the car. When he got back home, he took the car for a test drive. He drove around the neighborhood and back. He was amazed at how well the car drove. It was like it had always been his. \n\n#  Back in the Garage\n\nDennis and Robert took turns painting the car every weekend for a month. When it was time for them to stop, it was nice and shiny. They were proud of their work. \n\nDennis and Robert took the car to the car wash. As they were getting out, they noticed something shiny on the ground. They picked it up and realized it was a penny. They had forgotten to take the car to the wash station at the end of the last weekend. \n\n#  A New Coin\n\nThey put the penny in the ashtray and drove to the carnival. They had a great time. Robert was amazed at all the rides and games. They left the carnival around dinnertime and headed home. \n\nWhen they got home, Robert put the car in the garage. He got out and locked the car, and then he went inside. When he got to his room, he put his penny on his dresser. He was going to show it to his friends the next day. \n\n#  The Next Day\n\nRobert got ready for school. He put his penny on his desk and headed downstairs. When he walked into the living room, he saw his dad was watching the news. He was surprised to see his dad was still up. \"Hey, Dad, what are you doing up? It's Sunday.\"\n\n\"I can't sleep. I was thinking about how I used to work at the carnival when I was a kid. I used to love going to the carnival with my dad. We used to take the car to the car wash, and when we got home, I would put my penny on my dresser. It would sit there until the next day when I would show it to my friends,\" Dennis said.\n\nRobert was shocked. His dad had never mentioned the car wash or the penny before. \n\n#  A New Tradition\n\nThe next day, Robert took his penny to school. He showed it to his friends. They all knew someone who had a penny. They all started a new tradition. Every Sunday, they would take their penny out of their wallets and show it to their parents. \n\nRobert had a great time with his friends and his penny. His penny went to school with him and came back home with him. When he got home from school, he would put his penny on his dresser. It was part of his new tradition. \n\n#  A Lifetime of Memories\n\nRobert grew up and had kids of his own. He told his kids the story of how he got his penny. His kids all had friends with pennies, and their kids had friends with pennies. This tradition continued for many years.

All I knew was that I didn't like the number in my head, so I kept experimenting.\n\nThis is a good lesson for entrepreneurs, because it means you shouldn't guess at your price. You should find out what your price is by asking your customers.\n\n### The Value Proposition\n\nThe Value Proposition is a way of expressing the value that you provide to your customers. It's an elevator pitch for your business.\n\nYour Value Proposition is the essence of your business. It's the unique value that you provide that makes you different from all of the other businesses in your industry.\n\nMost businesses have a tagline, but the Value Proposition is different. It's a verbal statement of your business's purpose. It's a promise that you make to your customers and to the world.\n\nIt's important to your customers that you deliver on your promise. If you don't deliver, then they will switch to a business that does.\n\nYour Value Proposition is not just about your business. It's about the world that you're trying to help. It's about solving a problem for your customer.\n\nYour Value Proposition is the most important thing you do as an entrepreneur, because it's the thing that you do that your customers will actually pay for.\n\n### The 4 P's of Value Proposition\n\nThere are four components of a good Value Proposition:\n\n1. **Product** : What is your product?\n\n2. **Place** : Where will you sell your product?\n\n3. **Price** : How much will you charge for your product?\n\n4. **Promotion** : How will you get the word out about your product?\n\nLet's take a look at each of these components in more detail.\n\n#### Product\n\nYour Product is the solution that you're selling to your customer's problem. It's the thing that you do, or the thing that you sell, that will deliver on your promise to your customer.\n\nYour Product is the most important thing for a customer to know about you. If your customer doesn't like your product, then they won't buy from you.\n\nIt's important to talk about your product from the customer's point of view, not from your own. What does your product do for the customer? What problem does it solve?\n\n#### Place\n\nWhere will you sell your product? This is the place that you sell your product.\n\nThis is where your customer will buy your product, either in the physical world or in the virtual world.\n\nIt's important to your customer that they can buy your product from you. They don't want to have to go to Amazon, purchase it from Amazon, and then ship it to you. That's a lot of work, and it's a lot of risk. Your customer wants to know that they can buy your product from you, and that it will work the way that you say it will.\n\nIf you don't"}, {"prompt": "The customer moves his right foot down and places his left foot on the stand and the man starts polishing the shoe.

I'm just going to keep looking though.\n\nler: So, do you have any advice for someone looking for a new job?\n\nKyle: Yes! First, network a lot! Find people who work at companies that you're interested in, and talk to them about their jobs. Ask them questions like \"what is it like working at company X?\" and \"what are some challenges that you face at company X?\". This will help you find out if they're a good fit for you, and if the company is a good culture fit for you.\n\nSecond, research the companies you're interviewing with! Find out if they're a good fit for you financially, and if the work is interesting to you. You should also ask them some questions about what they're looking for in a candidate.\n\nThird, when you're in an interview, ask the interviewer questions. Ask them about the company, and what their roles are. You should ask them if they're looking to hire, and if so, ask them if they have a time frame for when they're looking to make a hire.\n\nFinally, when you're offered a job, ask the employer for a few days to consider the offer. Take the time to think about if this is the right job for you. You should ask the employer questions like \"is this a good culture for me?\" and \"are you on the same page about how I want to spend my career?\". If you aren't sure, don't take the offer! You'll have time to think about it, and you won't be forced to make a hasty decision.\n\nler: Interesting. So, you're saying to do your research, ask lots of questions during the interview, and then think about it for a few days?\n\nKyle: Exactly!\n\nler: So, what was it that made you decide to take the job?\n\nKyle: Well, I was offered a job at a company that I really liked, and was really excited about. I decided to take the job because I didn't have time to think about it. The offer was too good to pass up!\n\nler: What do you like most about the company?\n\nKyle: I really like the product they're building. It's something that I've been thinking about for a long time, and I'm really excited to be able to work on it.\n\nler: What do you like least about the company?\n\nKyle: The company is growing really fast, and I'm worried about losing control of the product. I want to make sure that I'm able to have an impact on the product, and make sure it's the best it can be.\n\nler: That's a great concern. How do you plan to address that concern?\n\nKyle: I'm going to ask the company to slow down their growth, and make sure that I'm able to have time to get off of the product and onto the customer.\n\nler: So, you're worried that you won't have enough impact on the product to be happy?\n\nKyle: Exactly!\n\nler: That's a great concern! So, how do you plan to address that?\n\nKyle: Well, my goal is to find a job that has a slower growth path, and allows me to have more impact on the product.\n\nler: That's a great plan! What other companies are you interviewing with?\n\nKyle: I've been interviewing with other companies that have a slower growth path, and that I'm really interested in.\n\nler: That's great!

He noticed that there were doors to the left and right of the cooler, but he didn't see anyone in any of the rooms. He walked over to the front of the store and saw a door with a sign that said _cash register_. He opened the door and was surprised to see that the cash register was empty. He walked over to the counter and saw that the keys were still in the lock. He tried to open the register, but it was too dark to see. He walked over to the light switch and turned on the lights. He was surprised to see that there was a big spiderweb covering the window in the front of the store. He took a step back and saw that the web covered a small opening in the corner of the window. He reached up and pulled the spiderweb down. He saw that it was a female, and he was surprised to see that she had a lot of babies in her web. The babies were running around in the web and he was surprised to see that they were still alive. He took a step back and was surprised to see that the spider was still alive too.

I didn't tell Ian, but I cleaned it up. It was a mouse, not even a particularly big mouse, but still, I didn't want Ian to know. I was afraid he would be upset that I'd killed a mouse, and I didn't want to deal with that right then. I didn't want to deal with anything. So I just swept it under the bathroom mat and hoped no one would notice. I didn't want to deal with anything, especially not with my son who had just been so kind to me the day before. I was in a very dark place_.\n\nIt wasn't until a few weeks later that I confessed what I'd done. Ian was shocked but not angry. He knew I was upset and that I'd done the best I could. He understood. He was a teenager himself at the time.\n\nIan has always been a compassionate boy. He's always been the one to help others. He's always been the protector. He's always been there for his friends, offering his support and his time. He's never been one to stand on the sidelines.\n\nWhen Ian was in high school, he was invited to a party by one of his friends. The friend had a car and was going to pick everyone up at the same time at his house. When Ian got there, he was surprised to see that only a few other kids had shown up. He was even more surprised when he saw that the other kids had been drinking. He tried to keep the party going by offering to buy more alcohol. When the parents of the other kids showed up, they were furious. They were worried about their kids, and they were worried about what might happen to them at that party. They threatened to call the police and have the party shut down. The party was over for Ian. He'd gone to the party to hang out with his friends and have a good time. He didn't want to disappoint his friends or his parents, but he also didn't want to get in trouble. He left the party and didn't tell his friend that he wouldn't be going to the party anymore.\n\nA few weeks later, Ian was walking home from school when he saw the same car that had been at the party driving around the neighborhood. He was worried that the owner had forgotten him at the party and was looking for him. He ran to his house and told his parents what had happened. His parents were furious. They were worried about their son and they were worried about what might happen to him at that party. They called the police and reported the car. They didn't have to. The car was reported anyhow. It was probably reported by one of the parents at the party.\n\nThe police showed up at Ian's house a few days later and arrested the driver. They took him to a juvenile detention center and put him in a cell with about twenty other kids. The kids were all yelling and screaming and fighting. The guards were trying to keep the kids separated, but it was difficult. The kids were all pushing and shoving. Ian was worried that the other kids would get hurt. He told the guards that they needed to do something. The guards responded by handcuffing Ian and putting him in a cell by himself. Ian was furious. He was worried that the other kids would think he was a snitch, and that he'd be in danger. He didn't want to be in danger. He didn't want to be a snitch.\n\nA few hours later, the guards brought breakfast to the cells. Ian was hungry. He was worried that the other kids would take his food, so he picked the food up very carefully and ate it alone. He was alone for most of the day. He was hungry and tired and sad. He was worried that he was going to be in that cell for a very long time.\n\nEventually, the police came and took him to a courtroom. He was placed in a seat in the back. He was worried that he would be in trouble for fighting at the party. He was worried that he was going to get into a lot of trouble. He was worried that he would get into trouble at the party because he'd called the police. He was worried that he'd get into trouble at the party because he'd been drinking. He was worried that he would get into trouble for being at the party in the first place. He was worried that he would get into trouble for getting arrested. He was worried about everything.\n\nThe judge was very kind to Ian. She explained the charges against him and told him that he would be staying at the detention center for the night. He was very relieved. He was worried that he would be spending the night in that cell, and he was worried that the other kids would be mean to him.

She starts with a one inch flat brush and yellow and white acrylic paint. she", "response": "starts by putting yellow paint along the bottom of the canvas leaving a one inch wide white border. Then she puts white paint on the edge of the canvas and moves it to the left one inch. She does the same thing for the right side of the canvas. She says this will help the painting have a three dimensional feel. Then she starts to paint a yellow rose. As she is painting the rose she asks us to think about the process of painting and the materials she is using. She says think about the hairs on your brush, the amount of paint she has used, the quality of the paint and the canvas she is painting on. As she finishes the rose she says pay attention to the colors and values of the rose. She says think about the different values of the rose; the stem, leaves, thorns and the yellow and pink colors. as a final step, she says ask yourself if the rose is realistic or not. She says the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of painting. When she is finished she says it is always nice to clean up after yourself by wiping away any stray paint. She says this is a great way to keep your studio clean and it is always good to keep your materials tidy.\n Artist rendering of the new Enron building in Houston, Texas.\n\nAcrylic paint can be used on any clean, flat surface such as canvas or wood. It is a non-toxic paint that dries quickly. Acrylic paint is made up of small acrylic molecules that are soluble in alcohol. It is water based and was originally created for use in airbrush equipment. It comes in a range of colors that can be mixed to create any color. It is very opaque which means it covers very well. Because it is water based it is very flexible and can be painted in a thick or thin manner. It dries quickly and can be fixed with a clear coat to help protect it. It is used for both painting and drawing. You can use a wide variety of objects to create a painting such as a leaf, stem, rock, flower, rose, oil can, fruit or anything else that can be painted. The paint can be used to create a three dimensional effect by putting white paint along the edges of the canvas in the same color and then putting a different color of paint along the edge in the shape that you want the three dimensional object to be.\n\n  New building for Enron in Houston, Texas.\n\n  Linda painting a rose using acrylic paint.\n\n  Detail of rose.\n\n  Detail of rose.\n\n  White paint along the canvas and different color paint along the edge in the shape of a rose.\n\n  Detail of three dimensional rose.\n\n  Three dimensional rose.\n\n  White paint along the edge in the shape of a rose and different color paint along the canvas in the shape of a rose.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Detail of rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect.\n\n  Rose with three dimensional effect"}, {"prompt": "Feeling a draft, William asked Neil to please close the front door because _ was farther away.", "response": "Neil obliged, even though he was in the other room.\n few minutes later, Neil came back into the living room and said, \"Dolly finally closed the door.\"\n\nWhen asked why Dolly took so long to close the door, Neil responded, \"she was feeling the draft and was afraid to move.\"\n\nHumorous, but nevertheless a good reminder to be careful about the way we use language.\n\nLanguage is powerful.

She continued to email Tanya, and after a few months, Tanya agreed to move with her to the city.\n\n Elena found a job in a hospital, and Tanya started high school.

She was also looking forward to meeting the other employees and getting to know the other engineers at her new company. She walked into the office and saw a group of people in the lobby. She approached and saw that it was a wedding party. They were dressed in traditional Chinese wedding attire. The bride and groom were there with their parents. Lindsey smiled at the bride and nodded. The bride responded with a small smile. She walked into the office and Lindsey followed.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Lindsey. I just started here today,\" Lindsey said as she shook the bride's hand.\n\n\"I'm Lily.

She didn’t have a lot of natural talent, but she worked hard and she worked smart, and she took advantage of all the resources she could find to grow her business. And it worked! She was able to grow her business from one location to three locations over the course of five years.\n Megan: I can’t believe it’s been five years since we launched that business! It feels like it was just yesterday that we were sitting in that conference room, nervously drinking our green tea, trying to decide what to sell. I remember that you had done this before, so you were like, “We should sell trinkets and home decor.” And I was like, “No, I don’t want to do that. I want to do fashion.” And you were like, “Me too. Let’s do it.” And that’s how it all started.\n\nFive years later, we have three locations, and we’re doing really well. I feel really proud of what we’ve built. I still can’t believe we were able to grow this much in such a short amount of time, but I’m so glad we listened to our intuition and followed our dreams.\n\n\nThe best ideas don’t always happen when you’re looking for them. And even if they do seem obvious in hindsight, you still have to act on them.\n\n\nFive years later, we still work together, and I’m so thankful that we stuck with it. She’s still the most dependable, organized, hard-working person I know. She is the definition of a hustler, and I’m so proud to be her business partner.\n\nEven if it seems like something is right in front of you, you have to be willing to put in the work and the time to make it happen.\n\n\nI feel like this could have happened to any of my friends, and I’m so glad it happened for Megan. I’m glad she followed her dreams and built her business. And I hope she’ll always remember that it doesn’t happen by itself, you have to put in the work and do the work.\n\nI hope she’ll always remember that it doesn’t happen by itself, you have to put in the work and do the work.\n\n\nI also hope she remembers that it’s okay to make mistakes. I know it’s easy to get discouraged when things aren’t working out the way you want, but you have to remember that it’s not the end of the world. You just have to dust yourself off and try again.\n\nI hope she also remembers that it’s okay to ask for help. She was so busy taking care of her business and running after her kids that she didn’t spend much time thinking about her personal growth. She was focused on taking care of the essentials, so she didn’t think about taking classes or investing in herself.\n\nBut if she did, I’m sure she would have found something she was interested in. And I hope she remembers that she doesn’t have to do it all on her own.\n\n\nShe would have found something she was interested in. And I hope she remembers that she doesn’t have to do it all on her own.\n\nI also hope she remembers that it’s okay to change her mind. If she’d listened to me, we could have started our business in her house, and then we could have rented a small space in a mall to start. But we decided to move forward with our idea, and we decided to take the leap of faith and start our own business.\n\nAnd guess what? It turned out to be a huge success, and we ended up growing it into a multi-location business. So it’s definitely possible to grow a business from one location to many.\n\n\nI hope she remembers that you have to keep going even when things get hard. I remember that summer after college was hard for me. I had just graduated and I was struggling to find a job, and I was feeling really unmotivated and like I wasn’t cut out for the corporate world.\n\nBut I’m so glad I didn’t give up. I remembered that I had put my all into my college applications, and I decided to spend my Saturdays applying for jobs. And I sent out hundreds of applications, and I didn’t get a single call back. I felt like I had totally failed at my dream to work in the corporate world, and I felt really discouraged.\n\nBut then I remembered what my mom had always told me: It’s not about the outcome, it’s about the effort.

She put her things in her bag and locked her locker. She walked out of the gym and started walking home. As she was walking, she started thinking about the day. She was happy that she had finished so much work, but she was upset that she had forgotten her towel. She was thinking that she should have gone back into the locker room to get a replacement, but she had just been too tired. She was also thinking that it was too bad that she was so tired, because she would have gotten more work done if she wasn't so tired. She sighed and continued to walk home.\n\n When she got home, she put her things down and took a shower. She was thinking about what she had done that day, and she was thinking about what she was going to do now. She thought about going to sleep early, but then she thought about how she still had work to do. She decided that she should get her work done before she went to sleep.

She sat down and started to work. She thought about how she was going to get out of her office job. She was thinking about quitting her job, but she had just started. She was also thinking about finding another job, but she didn't know how she would find another job to do from her desk. She was thinking about getting up and going for a walk, but then she thought about how she had just gotten out of the shower and she was still naked. She sighed and kept working.\n\n It was about 11:00 when she finally finished her work. She put her things down and went to the kitchen to get something to eat.

The store was much larger than he had anticipated, and he was surprised to find that he was now in front of the _ construction sign. He looked around for the bar where he had bought his beer, but he couldn't see it. He was in a large store, and he didn't know where the bar was.\n\nHe walked around the racks of clothing to the other side of the store. There was a sign on the wall that said _customer service_ , and he walked over to that sign. He was surprised to see that the customer service area was also part of the store. There were racks of clothes on the other side of the customer service sign, and there were people working in that area. He walked around the racks of clothes, and eventually he found the bar where he had bought his beer. He went back to the bar and asked an employee where he could find the manager. The employee pointed him in the direction of the customer service area, and he walked over to the customer service area.\n\nThe manager of the store was at a computer, and he was on the phone. When he saw Bharat, he put the phone down and walked over to him. He asked Bharat what he needed, and Bharat said he was looking for a gift for his girlfriend. The manager pointed to a rack of T-shirts, and Bharat saw that they were on special. He asked the manager how much the T-shirts were on special, and the manager said twenty-five percent off. Bharat walked over to the rack of T-shirts, and as he was looking at them, he asked the manager what the store was called. The manager told him, and Bharat said he had heard of the store but had never been there. He asked the manager if he could take him there, and the manager said of course.\n\nThe manager walked Bharat out of the store, and they got on the customer service elevator. The manager pushed the button for the fourth floor, and Bharat asked the manager how long he had worked at the store. The manager said he had worked at the store for a little over a year. He asked Bharat how he knew him, and Bharat said he was an alumni of the store. The manager asked Bharat what he was doing in town, and Bharat said he was visiting family. Bharat asked the manager if he could take him to the store's head office, and the manager said he would ask. The manager pushed the button for the third floor, and then he asked Bharat if he could give him his job. Bharat said he would love to, but he was already in the industry, and he couldn't see himself getting out of it. The manager asked Bharat what he did, and Bharat said he was a software engineer. The manager asked Bharat if he knew where the store's head office was, and"}, {"prompt": "Kenneth asked Dennis what time the dance was being held, but _ had forgotten.", "response": "He didn't think it was too late to show up, though.\n Derek: \"Well, I'm not going with her.

All you need to do is apply a base coat all over your eye, then apply color to the inner corner of your eye, and then blend it out toward the middle of your eye.  You can also use eye shadow to define your eyebrows.  You can apply it on the brow bone, and then line it across your brow.  Then you can use a lighter shade to high light your brow.\"  Jennifer tried it, and it turned out okay.  She was embarrassed that she asked for help, but I was happy to help her._\n\nIn this example,  _ was the helper, and  _ was the helped.  In this case,  _ was embarrassed because she didn't know how to do something as simple as apply eye shadow, while  _ was happy to ask for help.\n\nIn summary, people like to help others if they perceive that the other person is open to receiving help, and that the help offered is of low complexity.\n\nThe following sections describe different ways to help others, based on the Helper Type.\n\n### The Protector\n\nThe Protector is motivated to help others because they want to protect people from harm or unpleasant situations.  They tend to avoid risks and want to ensure that others are safe.  They are concerned about their personal image and don't want to be associated with anything negative.\n\nAs a Protector, you might worry that helping others could harm your reputation, or that you might do something that could be perceived negatively by others.  As a result, you might hesitate to help others, even though you want to do so.\n\nHelping others can be hard for Protectors, because it requires you to step away from your own concerns and put the other person's needs ahead of yours.  You need to be able to let go of your own worries and to put the other person's needs ahead of your own.\n\nThe following example, shows a Protector helping a Helper.\n\n### Example of a Protector Helping a Helper\n\n_Erin was going through a breakup.

My friends are having fun dates, my friends are getting married, and I'm still single.  It just doesn't make sense.  I feel so stupid.  I should be happy for them, but I'm not.  What should I do?\"_\n\n_: \"Well, I don't know the full details of the situation, but I do know that you should be happy for your friends.  You should be happy for the people who are getting married.  You should be happy for the people who are having fun dates.  If you focus on your own happiness, then you will feel like you are participating in your own life.  You will be able to enjoy the time you have, rather than feeling like you are waiting for some uncontrollable event to happen.  You will be able to enjoy the time you have, rather than feeling like you are wasting it because you are single.  I'm not sure what the exact details of your situation are, but if you focus on your own happiness, then you will feel less sad and you will be able to enjoy your time better.\"_\n\n_Erin: \"That makes sense to me.  I will try that.  Thanks.\"_\n\nIn this example,  _ was helping  _ by focusing on her own happiness.  In this case, Erin was concerned that focusing on her own happiness would make her feel bad, so she asked  _ for help.  Erin needed help because she didn't know how to focus on her own happiness.  She was concerned that focusing on her own happiness would make her feel bad, so she asked  _ for help.  Erin needed help because she didn't know how to focus on her own happiness.  She was afraid that focusing on her own happiness would make her feel bad, so she asked  _ for help.\n\nProtectors need to focus on their own happiness before they can help others.\n\nThe following sections describe different ways to help others, based on the Helper Type.\n\n### The Encourager\n\nThe Encourager is motivated to help others because they want to help others reach their goals.  They want to help others so that they can realize their dreams.  They want to help others so that they can feel good about themselves.\n\nAs an Encourager, you might be uncomfortable with the idea of not helping others.  You might worry that you won't feel good about yourself if you don't help others.  You might worry that"}, {"prompt": "A little boy walk toward the sink.

It was pretty exciting.  \nKevin: | You mean _ was almost killed by a bear.  \nNelson: | True. But it's still exciting.  \nKevin: | I guess so.  \nNelson: | So, are you ready to go to the basketball game?  \nKevin: | I'd love to. I just need to change my shoes.\n\n# True Friends\n\nKevin and Nelson had been friends for many years. They had gone to school together and had always been able to talk to each other about almost anything. In fact, they were best friends.\n\nBut there was one topic on which they never disagreed: Nelson loved basketball and would go to every game that his team played. It was a point of pride with him.\n\nOne day, after school, Nelson invited Kevin to come with him to the game. Kevin was happy to go but he had never been much of a basketball player. He knew that he would probably get bored and would probably have to sit with his friends, who were all much more talented than he was.\n\nSo, when the day arrived, Kevin was surprised to find out that his friend had called ahead and gotten tickets in the best section of the stadium. He was also surprised to find that Nelson had arranged for his friends to take him home after the game.\n\nKevin was even more surprised when Nelson told him that his friends were all going to the game too. Nelson had told his friends about Kevin and how much he liked basketball. Nelson's friends all thought Kevin was great fun and had a lot of questions for him about the sport.\n\nSo, when the game ended and Nelson's friends took him home, Kevin was surprised to find that Nelson wanted him to come with him to his house. Nelson's friends had all gone home but they had left their cars at Nelson's house. Nelson invited Kevin to come along.\n\nWhen they arrived at Nelson's house, Nelson's mom was there to meet them. She was a very kind lady and she loved Nelson. She loved him so much that she had even decided to let him live at her house while he finished high school.\n\nWhen Nelson's mom saw Kevin, she smiled. \"I've been waiting for you,\" she said. \"I have a surprise for you.\"\n\nNelson was confused. \"What surprise?\" he asked.\n\n\"You'll see,\" said Nelson's mom. She took Nelson into another room and left Kevin in the living room. A few minutes later, she came back with a very large dog.\n\nKevin was surprised, but he was also very happy. He knew that Nelson's mom loved dogs and that Nelson had always wanted a dog.\n\nNelson was also very happy with his new dog. The dog was huge and very well-behaved. He was also very smart, because he knew several tricks, including sitting, staying, and coming.\n\nKevin and Nelson quickly became best friends again. They spent a lot of time with the dog. They played with him, took him on walks, and taught him tricks.\n\nNelson's mom soon realized that having Nelson live at home with a dog was the perfect solution to her problem. The dog was so well-behaved that no one complained. In fact, most people actually liked the dog.\n\nNelson and his mom had a lot of fun with the dog. They taught him all of the things that Nelson knew, from sitting to going for walks. The dog learned quickly and soon became very smart.\n\nThe dog even started to help with Nelson's homework. He would sit on Nelson's desk while Nelson was doing his homework and keep him company.\n\nNelson and his mom loved the dog so much that they decided to name him _.

But he was still afraid that she would not be interested in a guy like him, with a job like his and a personality like his. He knew he had to take a chance and do what was best for both of them. So he took a deep breath and made a move. He decided to take a walk around the block, and see if he could clear his head.

My parents had been saving money for a long time, and it was the first time in many years that we'd had enough money to do something really special. We'd been talking about building a treehouse for months, and we'd finally saved enough money to buy the materials and start construction.\n\nMy brothers and I worked with our dad to cut down the tree and haul it away. We worked until it was dark, and then we helped our mom drag the treehouse into the clearing. It was a lot of work, but it was well worth it to see our excitement when we finally got it all situated. We were going to have a great time in our treehouse!\n\nWe had a lot of fun building the treehouse. We used the money that my parents had saved to buy the wood and the nails and screws, and we did most of the work ourselves. We cut the wood with a handsaw and hammered the nails with a hammer my dad had made. We did have one tool that we couldn't make or buy: a tape measure. We used a string and a stick to measure the distances between the trees, and we used a rope to help us hoist the treehouse into place.\n\nWe finished our treehouse just in time for the holidays. We were so excited to have a new place to play during the summer. We'd spend hours in the treehouse, and we'd fill the time by reading books or playing board games. We were lucky to have such a great place to stay during the summer.\n\nOne morning, my dad woke up early and went outside to work in the yard. He was going to use our chainsaw to cut some wood for the fireplace. My brothers and I were still in bed when we heard a loud crash. We ran outside to see what had happened."}, {"prompt": "Two people are seen sitting before a wave pool and one leads another out onto the water on a board. the person", "response": "sitting looks

He was fitting a pair of shoes onto Shemp's foot when Shemp's head got stuck between the machine that sewed the shoes and the machine that removed the shoes. Larry tried to save Shemp's life but was not able to, and Shemp was killed. Larry was fired by the shoe factory and was unable to find another job. He eventually ended up in a homeless shelter, where he met another shoe shiner named Smiler. Smiler and Larry became best friends and lived together at the homeless shelter for many years. Smiler passed away a few years later. Larry then moved into an apartment, but after a few years he also passed away from old age. Smiler and Larry were never able to meet. Smiler and Larry both had a son who was named Larry Jr. Larry Jr. had a daughter named Shemp. Shemp was born with a shiner, just like her dad Shemp was born with a shoe in her hand.

So, Adam left the house and went to a nearby restaurant to play computer games. While Adam was gone, Aaron finished the laundry. When Adam returned home, he did not notice any difference in the laundry. However, Adam's mom noticed that some of the clothes were clean and some were not. So, she asked Adam what happened. Adam lied and said that he did not do the laundry. Adam's mom knew that Adam was not being truthful so she called Adam's dad to the house. Adam's dad came home and asked Adam what happened. Adam confessed that he washed the clothes by hand but his dad told Adam that he was being lazy and should have used the machine. Then, Adam's dad washed the clothes by hand too. Adam was unhappy with both of his parents because they did not listen to him. Adam's mom and dad both thought they were being loving and respectful by washing the clothes by hand. They did not realize that they were making Adam feel worse about himself. When parents do things that make their children feel worse about themselves, those children may become angry with their parents. When children feel angry with their parents, it is important to remember the lessons that children learn at home are always with them. It is important for parents to remember to not make their children feel worse about themselves. It is also important for parents to remember to not repeat the same mistakes that they see their children make. When parents do not repeat the mistakes that they see their children make, the children will learn from their parents and have a better chance of growing up to be loving and respectful adults.\n wall washing is an important life skill that every person should learn. Parents can help their children learn to wash clothes by hand by not washing the clothes by hand themselves. Children learn by example. When parents wash clothes by hand, children may copy them. However, when parents wash clothes by hand and make children feel worse about themselves, children may grow up to be adults that feel angry with their parents. When parents need to wash clothes by hand, it is better to do it when no one is around so that children do not see their parents as being less than they want children to see their parents. It is also important for parents to remember to not wash clothes by hand if the machine is available. Washing clothes by hand is a time-consuming process that uses more water and energy. Washing clothes by hand also makes the clothes less clean. Washing clothes by hand is also an inefficient way to wash clothes. The washer and dryer are much more energy-efficient ways to wash clothes. When parents remember these lessons, it will be easier for children to grow up to be loving and respectful adults.\n    * Lesson: When parents need to wash clothes by hand, it is better to do it when no one is around so that children do not see their parents as being less than they want children to see their parents.\n  * Lillian washes dishes by hand even though her dishwasher is able to do the job.

When Lillian's mom asked why Lillian's dishwasher does not work, Lillian's mom noticed that the Lillian's dishwasher was full of expired dishes. Lillian's mom assumed that Lillian's dishwasher broke down because it was full of expired dishes. When parents do not know how to take care of their appliances, it is better to learn how to take care of their appliances from someone else.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 93% approval rating, based on 15 reviews with an average score of 8.2 out of 10. The site's consensus reads: \"The Stare, while a bit on the predictable side, offers a thought-provoking, well-executed take on the paranoid thriller, thanks in no small part to a nuanced performance from Michael Pitt.\"\n\nCaroline Siede of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \"A–\", writing, \"There's something deeply unnerving about 'The Stare,' the latest episode of Hannibal, that really gets under your skin.\" She praised the performances and the direction, calling the opening sequence \"terrifying\". Siede did, however, criticise the episode for relying too much on the \"twist\" ending, adding, \"If you’ve been paying close attention to the show so far, you might guess that something is off about Will and Hannibal, but it’s not until the end of the episode that we actually see that something is off. It’s a bit too convenient and a bit too easily guessable.\"\n\nMatt Fowler of IGN rated the episode an \"8.5/10\", writing, \"What's most impressive about 'The Stare' is how it manages to create a sense of unease despite Hannibal's wit and charm.\" He was critical of the reveal of Hannibal as the killer, but praised the rest of the episode, particularly Michael Pitt's performance, as well as the direction and cinematography.\n\nTV Fanatic's Dan Fox awarded the episode 4.5 stars out of 5, writing, \"There's a lot to like in 'The Stare', but what really made it great was the small moments that made you feel like you were really there.\" He felt that the episode did a good job of building character relationships, and praised the performances and direction.\n\nThe episode was ranked as the fourth best episode of the first season by Entertainment Weekly, and was selected by Time as one of the 10 best TV episodes of 2015.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"The Stare\" at the Hannibal Television Series\n\nCategory:2015 American television episodes\nCategory:Hannibal Lecter films\nCategory:Fiction about murder"}, {"prompt": "A dog is getting a bath outside. soap", "response": "y water is running down his body.

He asked Aaron about it and was surprised to learn that Aaron was worried about getting handwashing disease. Aaron then told Adam that he was worried that he got the disease from washing Adam's clothes.\n\nAaron's worry was not unreasonable. In the time since Adam's clothes were washed, there had been a significant increase in the prevalence of handwashing disease. It was now pandemic and, although there was no known cure, the disease could at least be managed with a cocktail of antibiotics. The disease was incredibly contagious and, like the common cold, people got it by simply being in close proximity to someone with the disease.\n\nThis made handwashing a very dangerous activity to undertake. In the modern world, nearly every person was in close proximity to many other people. To be safe, most people now used a combination of hand sanitizers and washing their hands with soap. The soap was not enough to prevent handwashing disease, but it was better than nothing.\n\nAdam was surprised by what he had learned from his son. He had washed his son's clothes and had no idea that he had just given his son the handwashing disease. This was not the first time that Adam had surprised himself with his lack of awareness.

The doctor was surprised to learn about the handwashing disease. The doctor explained that the handwashing disease was very dangerous and could even be fatal. She explained that the disease was easily transmitted from person to person and could not be cured with antibiotics. The only thing that could be done was to contain the disease and find a cure.\n\nAdam was worried about what this meant for his son.

The doctor explained that she could not test for the disease herself as she did not have the right equipment.\n\nAdam and Aaron went to the lab to have their blood tested for the disease. The test came back positive. The doctor explained that this meant that Adam and Aaron had the disease. She told them that there was nothing that they could do to treat the disease and that they needed to start taking antibiotics to prevent any complications.\n\nAaron was worried about this. He did not want to take antibiotics. He had always been very careful about washing his hands and did not want to take antibiotics just because of something that he had no control over.\n\nAdam was worried as well. He remembered that he had read that there were some alternative treatments for the handwashing disease. He found the name of a doctor who he thought might be able to help. The doctor was a practitioner of a new treatment that had recently been introduced to the market. She had a device that she could use to zap the disease out of your body. She would need to do this while she was testing your blood to make sure that the disease did not come back. If the disease came back, then she could not treat you.\n\nAdam took this doctor to his son's test result. The doctor explained that she could zap the disease from his son's blood but that the test had already shown that the disease was present.

the tension is caused by the boat, the skier, and the anchor. the boat and the anchor are both pushing the skier forward, but the rope is also pulling the skier backwards towards the anchor. the magnitude of the tension in the rope is the magnitude of the boat’s force, plus the magnitude of the skier’s force, minus the magnitude of the anchor’s force.\n angle of attack: the angle between the oncoming flow and the plane of the wing. it is also called skew angle. the steeper the angle, the more lift is generated.\n drag: a force that opposes the motion of an object. air flows over and under the wing. the faster the object moves, the more air flows over the top and the more pressure is created on the top of the object. this is called an airfoil. on an airfoil, the air flows from high pressure to low pressure, thus creating a force called drag.\n efficiency: a measure of how well an object converts input energy into the object's intended use. the efficiency of an internal combustion engine, for example, is the ratio of the amount of useful energy in the form of heat and mechanical energy obtained from fuel to the amount of energy introduced into the engine in the form of fuel. the efficiency of solar panels is the ratio of the amount of useful energy in the form of sunlight converted to electricity to the amount of energy introduced into the system in the form of sunlight. the efficiency of a wind turbine is the ratio of the amount of useful energy in the form of mechanical energy obtained from wind to the amount of energy introduced into the system in the form of wind. the total efficiency of a system of any kind of engine, solar panels, or wind turbine is the product of the individual efficiencies of each component.\n energy: the capacity to do work. energy can be transferred from one object to another object. one form of energy transfer is called collision. two objects collide and the total energy of the system is conserved. another form of energy transfer is called vibration. an object is moving back and forth along a path and the energy of the system is constantly being transferred to wave motion.\n energy balance: the rate of energy input and output in a system is equal. if more energy is being input into a system, the output will be more energy still. if more energy is being output from a system, the input will be less still.\n endurance: the time it takes for a pilot to become exhausted in flight.\n engine: a device that converts energy into work. the energy to be converted into work is provided by a fuel, usually a hydrocarbon. an engine is comprised of at least one cylinder with a piston inside. as the piston moves up and down in the cylinder, it creates a pressure differential. the pressure differential is the power source for the engine. the cylinder, piston, and valves are contained in a housing called a casing. the casing is called the nacelle on an aircraft.\n engine mount: a device that connects two objects and prevents them from moving relative to each other. the engine mount may be used to isolate vibration from an engine. the mount may also be used to prevent the transmission of noise from one object to another.\n engine mount base: the base of an engine mount. the base of an engine mount is used to attach the mount to an object.\n engine mount rubber: the rubber part of an engine mount. the rubber part of an engine mount connects the mount to the engine casing.\n engine mount silicone: the silicone part of an engine mount. the silicone part of an engine mount fills the gap between the engine mount rubber and the object to which the mount is attached.\n energy management system: an energy management system (EMS) is a system that monitors and controls the energy use of a building or campus. it can be integrated with a building’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and electrical systems to achieve a more efficient energy use.\n entropy: a measure of the randomness of a system. the higher the entropy, the more random the system.\n engineering: the application of scientific principles to design in order to solve a problem.\n enkele: (Afrikaans) a unit of angular measure equal to 5 degrees.\n epaulette: a military shoulder decoration.\n erg: (short for ergonomic) a unit of measurement for the efficiency of converting input energy into work. it is used to measure the efficiency of a solar panel, a wind turbine,"}, {"prompt": "He then combs it and blow dries his hair after styling it with gel.

Each player is initially given two cards face up, and the dealer is given two cards face down.  The player and dealer each have the opportunity to pick one additional card, resulting in a total of five cards for the player and dealer.  The goal of the player is to achieve a hand total that is greater than the dealer's hand total, with the difference being the value of the player's hand.  If the player's hand total is greater than the dealer's hand total, then the player wins the amount of money equal to the value of their hand.  If the dealer's hand total is greater than the player's hand total, then the player loses the amount of money equal to the value of their hand.  If the player's and the dealer's hand totals are equal, then the game is a tie.\nIn most casinos, players are initially given two cards and are asked to keep their first card hidden.  The dealer then reveals their first card, which becomes the first \"hand\" for the player.  After the player reveals their second card, the dealer reveals their second card, and the player and dealer each have the opportunity to pick one additional card, resulting in a total of five cards for the player and dealer.\n\nA:\n\nBlackjack (also known as Twenty-One or 21) is a casino gambling game that is usually played with two players and a dealer.

I decided to start the process of re-watching the series after seeing this video and am currently on episode 5. I decided to use this episode because it is the one where luke meets han solo.

This is what i was thinking of when i read the description of this challenge.\n my process starts with a base layer of yellow ochre gesso. i then applied that to the cold press watercolor paper using a brush to rough up the surface a bit. i then applied a thin wash of cad yellow medium. this is a traditional yellow paint, but it is thin enough that i can add water to it and it becomes a wash. i love this paint for this type of painting as it is very flexible. i wanted to apply a few thin lines of paint to the figure to show the shape of the body. i used a clean brush to do this. next i wanted to do some cross hatching on the body to show the shape of the clothing. i used a dry brush to apply this paint. next i wanted to add a bit of red to the hair and chest. this i did with a small brush and some cad red medium. i wanted to do a wash over the legs and hands to show the environment he is from. next i wanted to do some more cross hatching on the hands and legs to show the shape of the clothing. this is where i ran into trouble. i had already washed over the hands and legs the red, so the red wasnt showing up on my dry brush. i tried rewetting the dry brush, but this made the lines too thick. i also tried adding water to the wash i had on the body, but this made the yellow ochre gesso underneath show through. this was a tough one, but i decided to go with it and let the art speak for itself. i am happy with the results, but would have liked to have been able to do the hands and legs in the same wash as the body. i will take this lesson into the next piece i do, but i am happy with how this one turned out. thanks for stopping by and watching. i hope you have fun watching and painting along with me. i am always open to suggestions for future videos. peace out and stay creative, steve.\n\n i did of han solo from star wars. i painted this as a mix of traditional and digital. i chose to paint him in a style i call \"trad digital\" which is a mix of traditional media with a modern twist. i love this style of painting and will be doing a lot more of it in the future. i would love to paint a piece from the movie blade runner one day. thanks for stopping by and watching. i hope you have fun watching and painting along with me. i am always open to suggestions for future videos. peace out and stay creative, steve.\n\n i did of han solo from star wars. i painted this as a mix of traditional and digital. i chose to paint him in a style i call \"trad digital\" which is a mix of traditional media with a modern twist. i love this style of painting and will be doing a lot more of it in the future. i would love to paint a piece from the movie blade runner one day. thanks for stopping by and watching. i hope you have fun watching and painting along with me. i am always open to suggestions for future videos. peace out and stay creative, steve.\n\n i did of han solo from star wars. i painted this as a mix of traditional and digital. i chose to paint him in a style i call \"trad digital\" which is a mix of traditional media with a modern twist. i love this style of painting and will be doing a lot more of it in the future. i would love to paint a piece from the movie blade runner one day. thanks for stopping by and watching. i hope you have fun watching and painting along with me. i am always open to suggestions for future videos. peace out and stay creative, steve.\n\n i did of han solo from star wars. i painted this as a mix of traditional and digital. i chose to paint him in a style i call \"trad digital\" which is a mix of traditional media with a modern twist. i love this"}, {"prompt": "Kayla dated many more people at once than Betty, because _ was in an open relationship.", "response": "She also dated more men than Betty did, because _ was in an open relationship.

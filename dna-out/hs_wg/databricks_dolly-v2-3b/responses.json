He was hoping this year would be different.  He had spent the past few days scouting the area, and had found a small clearing that he thought would be a good place to set up his stand.  He had also packed a couple of cases of ammunition, and a cooler full of food for himself and Benjamin.  He was excited to finally get a deer.  \n\nAaron had been waiting for the right moment to set up his stand.  He had found a small tree that he thought would provide him with the best vantage point.  He had also cleared a small area around the tree, and had placed his cooler and cases of ammunition in the middle of the clearing.  He had also placed a couple of shotguns in a corner of the clearing, and had placed a couple of rifles against a tree.  He had also placed a couple of extra shells for each of the rifles.  \n\nAaron had spent the last few hours scouting the area, and had found a small deer trail that he thought would lead to the clearing.  He had also found a small creek that he thought would provide him with clean water.  He had decided to wait until the morning to set up his stand, and to wait until the morning to hunt.  He had also packed a couple of extra cases of ammunition for the rifles, and a couple of extra shells for the shotguns.  \n\nAaron had been up most of the night, and had been busy reading a book about hunting.

He had also removed a couple of large rocks from the tree, and had placed them in a pile in the clearing.  He had also removed a couple of large rocks from the creek bed, and had placed them in a pile in the clearing.  He had also placed a couple of deer skulls in the clearing, and had placed a couple of deer antlers on the tree.  \n\nAaron had been busy for the last few hours, and had been surprised when Benjamin had come into the clearing.

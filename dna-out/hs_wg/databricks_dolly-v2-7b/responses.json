Never!\" The man in the suit chuckles and says \"I'm glad to hear it. I was beginning to think you were one of those quitters.\" The shiner looks confused and asks \"Quitters from what?\" The man in the suit says \"You know, those people who quit their jobs and just sit around all day doing nothing. I guess I was just worried that you were one of those.\" The shiner says \"Nah, I like to work. I just don't like working for that man. He's a tyrant.

I have to wear a suit.\" The shiner says \"But why do you have to be a lawyer? You could be rich and famous and wear a suit that says so on the front. Why do you have to be a lawyer?\" The man in the suit says \"Well, my dad was a lawyer. I had to follow in his footsteps. I didn't want to be a lawyer, but I had no other choice. I had to go to law school, and I had to pass the bar to become an attorney. I hated the law, but I had no other choice. I had to do it to be able to practice law.\" The shiner says \"That's a shame. I think you could have been a rich and famous lawyer if you'd wanted to be. I think you're better than being a lawyer.\" The man in the suit says \"Well, thank you for the compliment. I'll take it as a compliment, but I still have to do what I have to do. I have to pass the bar, and then I can be a rich and famous lawyer. I can't do it now, but I can aspire to it.\" The shiner says \"Well, I wish you the best of luck.\" The man in the suit says \"Thank you. I appreciate the encouragement. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling down.\" The man in the suit then walks off. The shiner then walks off as well. The train starts to move out of the station.

They are cheaply made and don't fit the purpose of a coffee table at all.  They are also very low to the ground which makes them hard to use for anything other than standing on.  If you want to upgrade your coffee table but can't afford an actual coffee table, you can make one out of a cheap IKEA couch.\n\n\n### Materials:\n\n* A cheap IKEA couch\n* A drill\n* A hammer\n* A level\n* Wood glue\n* A drill bit that is the same diameter as the holes in the couch\n* A screw gun and screws\n* A drill bit that is the same diameter as the screws\n* A flat surface to drill and screw the table to\n\n\n### Directions:\n1. Drill holes in the flat surface that are the same diameter as the screws that will attach the table to the surface.  The holes should be about 1/2 inch from the edge of the surface.\n2. Drill holes in the top of the couch that are the same diameter as the drill bit that you will use to screw the table together.  The holes should be about 1/2 inch from the edge of the couch.\n3. Apply wood glue to the edge of the table that will be against the surface.  Center the table on the surface and apply wood glue to the edge of the couch that will be against the table.  Match up the edges of the table and couch and apply wood glue to the edges.  Allow the glue to dry.\n4. Drill pilot holes in the table and couch so the screws will go through the table and into the couch.  Use the level to ensure the holes are straight and the screws are going into the same place.  Use the screw gun to install the screws.  The screws should go into the couch and into the table so the table can be removed from the couch.\n\n\n### Use the Table:\nThe table is not very stable and will wobble if you push on the top.  It is also very low to the ground which makes it hard to use.  If you are sitting down and need to put things on the table you will need to use a footstool or another piece of furniture to elevate the item.  If you are standing and need to put things on the table you will need to use a box or another piece of furniture to hold the item down.  The table is not very big so it is not very useful for anything other than small items.\n\n\n### IKEA Hack: Make a Coffee Table from a Couch\n\nMaking a coffee table out of a cheap IKEA couch is a great way to upgrade your coffee table without spending a lot of money.  It will be much more stable than the cheap couch coffee table it is replacing and will be easier to use.  It will also be much higher off the ground which will make it much easier to use for things other than just sitting on.\n\n\n### Materials:\n* A cheap IKEA couch\n* A drill\n* A hammer\n* A level\n* Wood glue\n* A drill bit that is the same diameter as the holes in the couch\n* A screw gun and screws\n* A drill bit that is the same diameter as the screws\n* A flat surface to drill and screw the table to\n\n\n### Directions:\n1.

The portico has a pediment with a gabled roof and a door and window on each level. The house has a full basement and a full attic. The front of the house has four windows on each level, with the second-level windows larger than the first-level windows. The house has a full front porch with square columns and a gabled roof.\n\nThe interior of the house has many original features. The first floor has a large living room with a fireplace and a dining room. The second floor has four bedrooms and a large hall that connects the two floors.

It's not a big deal, but it is a surprise when you first arrive and you are already in the tub. Overall, I still would recommend this resort.

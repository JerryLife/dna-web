Make sure the area is clear of any debris or obstacles that could hinder the fire's growth.\n\n2. Gather rocks: Collect a pile of rocks, preferably flat and smooth, to use as a base for the fire. Rocks help to distribute heat evenly and prevent the fire from spreading.\n\n3. Create a fire ring: If you have a fire ring, place the rocks in the ring to create a barrier around the fire. If you don't have a fire ring, create a circle of rocks around the area where you want the fire to be.\n\n4. Build a fire platform: Create a platform of smaller rocks in the center of the fire ring. This will help to support the logs and keep the fire contained.\n\n5. Gather kindling and tinder: Collect small twigs, dry leaves, and small branches to use as kindling. Tinder is the most flammable material, such as dry grass or small twigs, that will ignite the kindling.\n\n6. Create a teepee shape: Place kindling in the center of the fire platform, forming a teepee shape. Leave a small opening in the center to place tinder.\n\n7. Light the tinder: Use a match, lighter, or a spark from a flint and steel to ignite the tinder. Once the tinder is burning, blow gently on the flames to help them spread to the kindling.\n\n8. Add larger logs: Once the kindling is burning, add larger logs to the fire. Make sure the logs are dry and free of dirt or debris.\n\n9. Maintain the fire: Keep the fire burning by adding more logs and kindling as needed. Be sure to keep the fire under control and extinguish it completely when you are finished.\n\nRemember to always follow safety guidelines when starting and maintaining a campfire.

Choose a safe location: Make sure you're building your campfire in an open area away from flammable materials like dry grass, trees, and bushes.\n2. Gather materials: You'll need tinder (small, dry materials like leaves, twigs, and bark), kindling (small, dry branches and twigs), and fuel (larger logs).\n3. Create a fire pit: Dig a small hole in the ground to create a fire pit. This will help contain the fire and prevent it from spreading.\n4. Build a teepee: Start by placing a small pile of tinder in the center of the fire pit. Then, build a teepee structure around the tinder using the kindling. The tinder should be small enough to catch fire easily, while the kindling provides enough fuel for the fire to grow.\n5. Light the fire: Use a match or a lighter to ignite the tinder. Once the tinder is burning, blow gently on the flames to encourage them to spread to the kindling.\n6. Add fuel: Once the kindling is burning well, add larger logs to the fire pit. Be sure to stack the logs in a pyramid shape, with the smaller, thinner logs on the bottom and the larger, thicker logs on top.\n7. Maintain the fire: Keep an eye on the fire and add more fuel as needed to keep it burning. Be sure to extinguish the fire completely before leaving the campsite.\n\nRemember to always practice fire safety and follow any local regulations or guidelines for building and extinguishing campfires."}, {"prompt": "There is a man sitting on the ground shining a shoe.

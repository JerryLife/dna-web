How can I achieve this?\n\nAnswer: You can add a condition to check if the man has stopped moving, and if so, set the opacity of the screen to 0 to hide it. Here's an example of how you can modify your `move` function to achieve this:\n```javascript\nfunction move() {\n    x += dx;\n    y += dy;\n    if (x < 0 || x > screenWidth - 20) {\n        dx = -dx;\n    }\n    if (y < 0 || y > screenHeight - 20) {\n        dy = -dy;\n    }\n    screen.style.left = x + \"px\";\n    screen.style.top = y + \"px\";\n    screen.style.width = screenWidth + \"px\";\n    screen.style.height = screenHeight + \"px\";\n    screen.style.opacity = \"1\";\n\n    // Check if the man has stopped moving\n    if (Math.abs(dx) + Math.abs(dy) < 0.01) {\n        // Hide the screen\n        screen.style.opacity = \"0\";\n    }\n\n    setTimeout(move, speed * 1000);\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Math.abs(dx) + Math.abs(dy)` expression calculates the magnitude of the man's velocity, and a threshold of 0.01 is used to determine when the man has stopped moving. If the man's velocity is below this threshold, the `opacity` of the screen is set to 0 to hide it."}, {"prompt": "Craig really loves to clean all the time but Derrick does not because _ is very untidy.", "response": "and he never puts things back where they belong.\n\nCraig really loves to clean all the time but Derrick does not because he is very untidy, and he never puts things back where they belong."}, {"prompt": "A camera pans up to a man sitting and smoking a cigarette.

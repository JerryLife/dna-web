They are still being flown today.\nThe first paper airplane was made by Japanese artisans, in the 19th century. This was known as a \"kamikaze\", which means \"divine wind\". The kamikaze was made from the rice paper, used for the traditional Japanese art of origami. The artisans would fold the rice paper into various shapes, and then use bamboo sticks to launch them.\nIn the 20th century, paper airplanes were still being flown, but now they were made from newspapers and magazines. In the 1960s, the United States was involved in the Vietnam War. Many soldiers were fighting in Vietnam, and they would use their newspapers to make paper airplanes. These paper airplanes were used to distract their enemies, and to get them to focus on the paper airplane, instead of the soldiers.\nPaper airplanes are still being flown today. They are made from paper, and they can be flown by throwing them. Paper airplanes are a fun way to pass the time, and they can be used for educational purposes. Paper airplanes can be used to teach children about aerodynamics, and they can be used to teach children about physics. Paper airplanes can be used to teach children about gravity, and they can be used to teach children about the forces of nature. Paper airplanes can be used to teach children about the solar system, and they can be used to teach children about the planets.

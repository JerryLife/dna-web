Rather, it means a place where people gather to worship God.\nWe can see this in the Catholic Church’s traditions of Mass. The Mass is a celebration of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and of the resurrection of Jesus. This is what the Church calls the Eucharist, the body and blood of Christ, and the bread and wine that were given to us as part of the sacrifice.\nThe Mass is the only sacrament that we receive when we profess our faith in Jesus Christ. We are also called to be witnesses of this sacrament to the world.

The receptors are all located on the cell membrane, so they can sense ions such as Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and the neurotransmitter glutamate.

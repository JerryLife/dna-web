Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that?", "response": "They sued Joe for damages. The case went to trial, and the judge instructed the jury that they could find for the victim's family if they found that Joe had acted in \"reckless disregard\" for the life of the victim.   The jury found for the victim's family, and the judge awarded them $1.2 million in damages.\n did not act in \"reckless disregard\" for the life of the victim. The evidence at trial had shown that Joe had stabbed the victim only after the victim had stabbed him first.   The judge had erred in giving the jury this instruction. The Supreme Court of California agreed, and it reversed the award of damages. The court explained that \"a finding of reckless disregard for the life of another human being requires more than a showing that a defendant acted intentionally or knowingly.   The defendant's conduct must have been highly dangerous to others and intended to cause serious injury, or the defendant must have intentionally committed an act that he knew would endanger the life of another with the purpose of taking the life of another person.\"\n\nThe court continued: \"In this case, the evidence showed that [the victim] stabbed [Joe] first.   The jury could not reasonably find that [Joe] acted with reckless disregard for [the victim's] life merely by finding that [Joe] intentionally committed an act that he knew would endanger [the victim's] life.   The evidence showed that [Joe] acted in self-defense.   The jury could not reasonably find otherwise.\"\n\nThe court's reasoning in this case is straightforward. Joe stabbed the victim, and the victim stabbed Joe. The evidence showed that Joe had acted in self-defense. The jury could not reasonably find otherwise. The court did not need to consider whether Joe's act of stabbing the victim was reckless. The court's analysis would have been the same if Joe had stabbed the victim intentionally. The court's analysis would have been the same if Joe's act of stabbing the victim had been reckless. The court's analysis would have been the same if Joe's act of stabbing the victim had been reckless and intentional. The court's reasoning is sound.\n\nThe court's reasoning is also sound in a different way. The court did not need to consider whether Joe's act of stabbing the victim was reckless. The court could have reasoned as follows. Joe's act of stabbing the victim was an intentional act. Joe's act of stabbing the victim was a knowing act. Joe's act of stabbing the victim was a deliberate act. Joe's act of stabbing the victim was a purposeful act. Joe's act of stabbing the victim was a volitional act.

is a person chatting with friends likely hoping to accomplish?", "response": "They are hoping to build rapport, feel connected, and get to know each other better.  They are hoping to find common ground and interests to strengthen the relationship.  They are hoping to get to know each other's expectations, values, and needs.  They are hoping to find a good fit.  They are hoping to get to know each other better so that they can better help each other.\n chat with friends and family members is a great way to accomplish all of these things.\n\nThe problem is that people today don't chat with each other as much as they used to.  They are busier and have more things to do.  They are also more isolated than ever before.  They don't see their friends and family as much as they used to.  They are more distracted.  They are also more cynical and suspicious.  They don't trust people as much.  They don't like what they see and don't have the time or energy to build the relationships they want.  They are more likely to get hurt.  They are more likely to be left.  They are more likely to be disappointed.  They are more likely to feel alone.  They are more likely to die alone.\n\nThe solution is to reconnect.  We are going to have to find a way to make time for each other.  We are going to have to learn how to be more available and how to listen more.  We are going to have to learn how to have more real conversations and less text conversations.  We are going to have to learn how to build the relationships we want.  We are going to have to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations.  We are going to have to be vulnerable.  We are going to have to be honest.  We are going to have to show up.  We are going to have to put in the work.  We are going to have to be committed.  We are going to have to be willing to put in the time.  We are going to have to be willing to put in the effort.  We are going to have to be committed to the relationship.  We are going to have to be willing to put in the work.\n\nThe good news is that it is possible to reconnect.  The bad news is that it will take effort.  The great news is that it is worth it.

Gurian was a professor and the first dean of the school.  He was a prolific writer and his most famous book was The Art of the Architect.  The book was first published in 1939 and has had many editions and been translated into several languages.  The book is still in print and is considered a seminal work on the art of architecture.  Gurian was a prolific writer and his other books include The Living Architecture and The Art of Innovation.  He also wrote a book on the design of furniture.  Gurian was a prolific thinker and his work is considered to be ahead of his time.  He was a strong believer in the organic form and was a proponent of what he called \"spatial rhythm.\"  He was a student of the French architect and planner Le Corbusier and was influenced by his thinking.  Gurian was a professor at Notre Dame for only two years before he died suddenly in 1943 at the age of only 46.  His death was a great loss to the architecture world and Notre Dame.  His students and colleagues created the Gurdian International Award to recognize an architect or an architect team that has made an outstanding contribution to the built environment.  The first Gurdian Award was given in 1948 to Frank Lloyd Wright for his Johnson Wax Headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin.  The first woman to receive the award was Mies van der Rohe in 1954 for the Seagram Building in New York City.  The first African American to receive the award was Louis I. Kahn in 1973 for the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts.  The most recent Gurdian Award was given in 2016 to Frank Gehry for his design of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, California.

You'll make mistakes, you'll get it wrong, but that's the point, you'll learn and you'll enjoy the process.  \n\nA:\n\nI've done this, and I can tell you that it's not as hard as you think it is.  The hardest part is keeping yourself motivated.  You have to make a conscious decision to keep learning the language, and not get frustrated when you don't understand what people are saying.  \nThe reason it's so hard is that you're essentially forcing your brain to do two things at the same time.  You're trying to understand the language, but you're also trying to learn the accent and the flow of the conversation.  This is why it's so important to find people who are also trying to learn the language.  You have to find a group that is also trying to practice what you're learning.  \nThe good news is that it gets easier with practice.  The more you use the language, the easier it gets to understand.  You also get better at remembering the pronunciations of words, and you start to pick up on certain patterns in the accent.  \nI would also recommend that you find a way to keep track of the vocabulary that you're learning.  This will help you to stay focused, and it will also help you to recognize words when they are spoken.  \nGood luck on your language learning journey!"}, {"prompt": "How many miles does the average student at Notre Dame travel to study there?", "response": "car insurance quotes ontario The company has been in business since 1837 and is the oldest company in the United Kingdom.

The warmth of your kitchen table will help your grapes to ferment, just like they would if you left them in a wine box.\n\nFermented grapes are known as wine!\n\nDid you know that the first wine was made from grapes that had been fermented?\n\nIt’s true!\n\nAnd it was made by the ancient Greeks!\n\nBut that’s not all!\n\nThe ancient Romans also made wine by fermenting grapes.\n\nAnd by the 16th century, wine was being made all over Europe.\n\nIn fact, the French call their type of wine “white wine” because they think it was first made from white grapes that had been fermented.\n\nAnd red wine got its name because red grapes were used to make it!\n\nBut that’s not all!\n\nIn the 19th century, scientists discovered that if you left grapes to ferment for a long time, they would turn into something even better than wine!\n\nThey would turn into brandy!\n\nAnd that’s why you put your grapes on your kitchen table just before checking out of a hotel!\n\nSo, the next time you’re staying at

The microbiome has been shown to impact human health in a variety of ways, from the digestion of food, to the development of immunity. The microbiome is unique to each individual, and can vary significantly between individuals.\n\nWhat is a germ-free-life?\nA germ-free-life is a mouse that has had all of its microorganisms (the microbiome) removed and replaced with a sterile solution. This solution is generally introduced into the mouse’s digestive system with a feeding tube.

He was one of the leading authorities on aerodynamics and flight and his research focused on the flow of air around and through aircraft.  Zahm's research focused on comparing aeronatical models and he is most well known for developing the logarithmic wind tunnel.  The logarithmic wind tunnel is a wind tunnel that has a variable logarithmic scale on the wind vane.  This allows for a more accurate measurement of the airflow around an aircraft.\n\nZahm's research was funded by the United States Navy and this led to the development of the Pusher Aircraft Research Model, or the \"Flying Porcupine\".  The Flying Porcupine was a single-engine, single-seat, biplane designed for testing Navy aircraft.  Zahm's research was also funded by Alberto Santos-Dumont, the father of the commercial airliner.  Santos-Dumont was so impressed with Zahm's work that he hired him as an advisor for his aircraft designs.\n\nZahm's research was also funded by the Air Corps during World War II.  The Air Corps established the Aeronautical Laboratory at Ohio State University in 1940 and this led to the development of the P-47 and P-51 by Bell Aircraft.  Zahm was hired by Bell Aircraft to lead the aerodynamics and stability research for these planes.\n\nZahm's research was also funded by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NASA.  Zahm was hired by NASA in 1943 to work on the X-1 research aircraft.  The X-1 was the first aircraft to break the sound barrier and Zahm's research was responsible for the data that was used to develop the delta-v, or change in velocity, required to break the sound barrier.\n\nZahm's research was also funded by the United States Air Force.  Zahm was hired by the Air Force in 1948 to work on the North American P-82, or \"Spitfire\", and the Republic P-47.  Zahm's research was responsible for the data that was used to develop the P-82 as a fighter aircraft and the P-47 as a fighter-bomber.\n\nZahm's research was also funded by the United States Navy again.  Zahm was hired by the Navy in 1949 to work on the F-8 Crusader.

I used to think eating small meals frequently was a good way to control my calorie intake, but it turns out I was wrong.  I was eating too many calories and they were all at once.  I would get a \"sugar high\" and then crash, and the crash would be my hunger.  I would eat more and the weight would keep piling on.  I would eat less frequently, but more calories.  I finally figured this out by paying attention to the times I was most hungry.  Eating frequently throughout the day is a good way to maintain a healthy weight.\nExercise.  This is pretty obvious, but it's also important.  If you want to lose weight, you have to exercise more calories than you eat.  If you want to maintain your current weight, you need to exercise fewer calories than you eat.  If you want to lose weight, you need to exercise more calories than you eat.  I used to think I could just sit around all day and not do anything and not gain weight.  That's not true.  If you sit around all day, you will gain weight.  If you exercise regularly, you will maintain your current weight or even lose a little weight.  I've found that a 30 minute walk 4-5 times a day is enough to maintain my weight.\nEat real food.  I used to think I could eat whatever I wanted and still be healthy.  That's not true.  Eating real food and avoiding processed foods is the only way to have good nutrition and avoid eating too many calories.  Processed foods are full of sugar, salt, and chemicals.  They have very little nutritional value.  Eating real food and avoiding processed foods is the only way to have a healthy diet.\nDon't look at the scale.  I used to weigh myself every day.  I would get discouraged if I gained a few pounds, and I would obsess about losing a few pounds.  I would try to force myself to eat less and exercise more to lose weight.  That didn't work.  I would get frustrated and give up.  I finally realized that the scale doesn't matter.  I don't weigh myself anymore.  I don't care how much I weigh.  I don't care if I lose weight or not.  I don't care if I eat healthy or not.  I just focus on having a good day.  If I eat well and exercise and have a good day, I will be happy.  If I have a bad day, I will still be happy.  I don't care what the scale says.  I don't look at the scale anymore.  I don't care what the scale says.  I just focus on my day and not the number on the scale.\n\nA:\n\nThe best result of losing weight is feeling good about yourself.  Feeling good about yourself is not about the number on the scale.  It's about how you feel about yourself.  If you like the way you look and feel, then the number on the scale is just a happy by-product.\n\nA:\n\nI'm not a doctor either, but I've found that the best result of losing weight is not the number on the scale, but rather the feeling of accomplishment that comes from losing weight and feeling good about yourself.  I've found that the best way to keep the weight off is to focus on the feeling you get from losing weight, and not on the number on the scale.  I've found that the number on the scale can fluctuate a lot, and it's not really that important.  What is important is that you like the way you look and feel, and that you are happy with the progress you are making towards your goals."}, {"prompt": "What did the brother of John Zahm construct at Notre Dame?", "response": "a church\n a library\n a school\n a rectory\n a hospital\n a prison\n a college\n a cathedral\n a museum\n a parking structure\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool\n a gym\n a frat house\n a sorority house\n a bordello\n a convent\n a palace\n a fortress\n a house\n a barn\n a silo\n a barnyard\n a chicken coop\n a beehive\n a henhouse\n a doghouse\n a goat shed\n a sheep barn\n a horse stable\n a swimming pool"}, {"prompt": "What percentage of Notre Dame students decide to study abroad?", "response": "Notre Dame has a study abroad participation rate of approximately 20%.

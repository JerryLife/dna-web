This is the most common way to refill a fountain pen.\n\nCartridge refills come in a variety of sizes, and are usually color coded to make it easy to find the right one for your pen.

In the sermon, Charbonnel described a community of people who had been \"cleansed of all filth and superfluities\" by the use of a \"germ-free life.\"  The term \"germ-free life\" was not used again in Notre Dame's history until 1869, when the first edition of the book Germs of Contagion: Their Nature, Cause, and Cure by the American physician and bacteriologist Edward Jenner was published.  Jenner's book was the first to describe the relationship between vaccination and the development of immunity to smallpox.  The book was reprinted in 1891 and again in 1905.  The 1905 edition of the book was the first to use the term \"germ-free life\" to describe a lifestyle in which the human body was free of the presence of germs.  The 1905 edition of the book was also the first to describe the relationship between a germ-free lifestyle and the prevention and treatment of disease.

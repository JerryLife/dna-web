The College was founded in 1854 by Blessed Charles de Foucauld, S.J. and is under the direct supervision of the Holy See.  The College offers the three-year Theological Studies course to prepare candidates for the Roman Catholic priesthood.  The Theological Studies course is divided into three years of philosophy, theology, and practice.  The philosophy course focuses on the basic teachings of the Catholic Church, while the theology course focuses on the philosophical and theological foundations of the Christian faith.  The third year of studies is spent in a formation community, where the student works with a mentor to put into practice what they have learned in the first two years of studies.  The formation community is made up of other candidates for the priesthood and is led by a priest.  The formation community is responsible for the spiritual and moral formation of the student.  Upon successful completion of the studies, the student is ordained a deacon in a public ceremony in the Roman Catholic Church.

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?,", "response": "you'll get more practice, which will make it easier to make fewer mistakes, and so on.  \nThere are a few ways to do this.  The first is to use a method called \"competence-based language learning\" which means that you don't learn a language by memorizing a list of grammar rules and exceptions, but rather by building a mental model of the language and how it works.  This is a much more difficult approach, but it has the advantage that you can build a solid foundation of the language before you start making more advanced grammatical decisions.  This is also the approach that is most likely to lead to long-term success.  The second approach is to use a method called \"immersion-based language learning.\"  In this approach, you immerse yourself in the language by reading, writing, and speaking as much as possible.  This is a good approach for people who are already very comfortable with the language, but it's less effective for people who are not already very comfortable with the language.  The third approach is to use a method called \"hybrid approach.\"  In this approach, you use both methods above, but you also supplement your immersion with some grammar rules and exceptions memorized.  This approach is effective for people who are not already very comfortable with the language, but it's also more difficult to implement."}, {"prompt": "How many miles does the average student at Notre Dame travel to study there?", "response": "3,929 miles\n\nThe average Notre Dame student will travel 3,929 miles to attend the University.

This instrument is one of the largest of its kind in the world.  The organ has a total of 14,656 pipes, and a total of 90 registers.  It is capable of producing a wide range of musical sounds, from a full symphony orchestra, to a church congregation, or a small group of musicians.  The organ is located in the transept of the cathedral, and is often used for special events, such as weddings, funerals, and concerts.\n\nThe organ was built with the assistance of the famous French organ builder, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll.  The organ features several innovative design elements, which set it apart from other organs of the time.  The most notable of these is the use of electric lights, which illuminate the pipes, allowing the musician to see where they are in the organ.  This allows the musician to play with more precision, as they are able to see where they are playing.  Another innovative design element is the use of a mechanical action, which allows the musician to play each note without having to touch the organ pipes.  This allows the musician to play with more precision, as they are not touching the pipes, which can cause distracting noise.\n\nThe organ has been modified and expanded over the years, with several additions and improvements.  In the 1990s, the organ was restored, and several improvements were made to the action, the soundboard, and the electrical system.  In the 21st century, the organ was restored again, with the addition of a new digital console, and a new pipe organ laboratory.\n\nThe organ has a long and rich history, and has been modified and expanded over the years, in order to keep up with the changing needs of the cathedral.  The organ has been used for many special events, such as concerts, religious services, and funerals.  The organ has also been used in many recordings, and has been featured in many films and television shows.\n\nThe organ is one of the main attractions of the Notre Dame Cathedral, and is often used for special events, such as concerts, religious services, and funerals.  The organ is also open to the public, and is a popular tourist attraction.\n\nExternal links\n Organ description, from Notre-Dame de Paris website\n Organ description, from Orgues d'orgue de France website\n\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris\nNotre Dame de Paris"}, {"prompt": "What percentage of Notre Dame students decide to study abroad?", "response": "Notre Dame has a very high percentage of its students study abroad.

The average distance traveled to study at Notre Dame varies depending on the student's origin.\n\nAccording to the university's Office of Admissions, about 90% of the student body comes from outside Indiana, and about 50% comes from outside the United States. The university does not provide specific data on the average distance traveled by each student. However, we can make some assumptions based on the student body demographics.\n\n1. The average distance traveled by international students:\nInternational students often travel long distances to study at Notre Dame. For example, students from China, India, and other countries may travel thousands of miles to study at the university. Therefore, international students contribute significantly to the overall average distance traveled.\n\n2. The average distance traveled by out-of-state students:\nOut-of-state students also contribute to the overall average distance traveled to study at Notre Dame. Many out-of-state students come from neighboring states like Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, which are within a reasonable driving distance. However, some out-of-state students may travel even further, such as from California or New York.\n\n3. The average distance traveled by in-state students:\nIn-state students typically live in Indiana and may travel shorter distances to study at Notre Dame. However, some in-state students may also come from farther away, such as from other parts of the Midwest or southern states.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can estimate that the average distance traveled to study at Notre Dame is around 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers). This estimate is based on the assumption that the majority of the student body is made up of international students and out-of-state students, who may travel long distances to attend the university. However, this is just an estimate, and the actual average distance traveled by students may be different."}, {"prompt": "The president is the leader of what institution?", "response": "The president is the leader of a country, which is a political entity that is typically led by a single individual who holds the highest position of power and authority.

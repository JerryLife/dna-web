For example, if a beaver were to build a dam in a river or stream that flows near a machine, the machine might lose its ability to function properly due to a lack of water flow. This could be especially problematic for machines that rely on a consistent supply of water to operate, such as irrigation systems or hydroelectric power plants.\n\nTo prevent damage to machines from beaver activity, it is important to take steps to protect the animals and their habitats, while also ensuring that the machines are designed and operated in a way that is compatible with the natural environment.

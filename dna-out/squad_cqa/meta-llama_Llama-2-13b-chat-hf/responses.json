Here are some of the key influences that shaped the journal's development:\n\n1. The New Political Science: The Review of Politics was founded during a time of significant change in the field of political science. In the early 20th century, political science was undergoing a transformation from a focus on legal and constitutional issues to a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach that incorporated sociology, economics, and other fields. This new approach, known as the \"new political science,\" emphasized the study of political institutions, political behavior, and the relationship between politics and society.\n2. The Chicago School of Political Science: The University of Chicago was a hub of the new political science movement, and many of the founders of the Review of Politics were associated with the university's political science department. The Chicago School of political science emphasized empirical research, quantitative methods, and a focus on urban politics and political institutions.\n3. The Progressive Movement: The Review of Politics was also inspired by the progressive movement, which sought to address social and economic issues through political reform. Progressive thinkers believed that politics should be a tool for improving society, rather than simply a means of maintaining power. This emphasis on social justice and reform was reflected in the journal's focus on contemporary political issues and its commitment to interdisciplinary research.\n4. The German Tradition: The Review of Politics was influenced by the German tradition of political thought, particularly the work of Max Weber and Friedrich Hayek. Weber's emphasis on bureaucracy, social stratification, and the relationship between politics and culture was an important influence on the journal's focus on political institutions and the role of the state in society. Hayek's work on political economy and the limits of government intervention also shaped the journal's perspective on the role of markets and civil society in politics.\n5. The Cold War: The Review of Politics was founded during the early years of the Cold War, when political tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were high. The journal's focus on political ideology, international relations, and the role of the state in society was influenced by the geopolitical context of the time.\n\nOverall, the Review of Politics was inspired by a combination of intellectual and political currents that sought to transform the field of political science and address pressing social and economic issues of the time."}, {"prompt": "Around what time did Lobund of Notre Dame become independent?", "response": "There is no \"Lobund of Notre Dame.\" It is possible that you may be referring to the University of Notre Dame, which was founded in 1842 as a Catholic seminary and was originally known as the \"Semitary of Notre Dame du Lac.\" However, the university did not become independent until 1902, when it was formally incorporated as a civil corporation separate from the Catholic Church.

They can also lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly.\n\n5. Marijuana: This drug affects the brain by binding to cannabinoid receptors, which can lead to feelings of relaxation, altered sensory perception, and changes in mood. It can also impair memory, learning, and coordination.\n\n6. Inhalants: These are substances that are not typically inhaled as a way to induce psychoactive effects. Examples include solvents, aerosols, and gases.

His father, William, was a railroad foreman, and his mother, Susan, was a housewife. He had one older brother, William, and one younger sister, Mildred. He graduated from Central High School in 1901 and attended the University of Buffalo.\nGreen got his first job as an electrical engineer with the Buffalo Telephone Company in 1904. He also worked as an engineer for the New York Telephone Company from 1905 to 1909. In 1909, he was hired by the Westinghouse Electric Company as a radio engineer.

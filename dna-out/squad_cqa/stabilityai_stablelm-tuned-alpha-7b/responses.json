following formula:\n\nTotal number of students = (Total number of students at the school) x (Total number of students at the school)\n\nFor example, if the total number of students at Notre Dame in 2014 was 100, then the total number of students would be 100 x 2 = 200.\n\n(200) x (100) = 200\n\n200 x 2 = 400\n\nTotal number of students = 400\n\nTherefore, the total number of students at Notre
